smiling warmly
laughing mid-conversation
crying softly
frowning in frustration
glaring with anger
looking surprised
expressionless and calm
blushing with embarrassment
grinning mischievously
wide-eyed and curious
nervously biting lip
yawning sleepily
furrowing brows in confusion
sighing in relief
eyes closed in serenity
smirking confidently
teary-eyed with joy
