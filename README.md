### üíñ Why This Exists

Built to speed up character creation, prompt variety, and storytelling across AI tools. I use it personally for Stable Diffusion generations and ChatGPT-based experiments to explore aesthetics, worldbuilding, and design variations without rewriting every prompt by hand.

### ü§ñ Project Attribution

All wildcard content and prompt templates were organized with the help of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) by OpenAI.

Huge thanks to the assistant for helping turn fragmented notes and ideas into a flexible creative system.
